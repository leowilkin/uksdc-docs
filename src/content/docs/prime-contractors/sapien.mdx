## foundations

A three-part collaboration by Sapæn- the Danish flatpack furniture giant, Instruments Helvétique- a Swiss medical robotics and pharmaceuticals group, and 木漏れ日 (Komorebi)- the Honshu-based artistic architecture enterprise, Sapien was formed in 1983. A serendipitous liaison at ETH Zurich brought the three companies together, uniting by their shared drive towards a happier, healthier, and more beautiful future. For the site's role in its foundation, Sapien has funded and designed the Shikaku (視覚) Institute for architecture, medicine, and health technology at ETH Zurich.

Offered terrestrial opportunities by the Foundation Society and private developers for urban redevelopment, Sapien implemented smart environments with innovative embodiments of light and form. Sapien's earliest developments, in Belo Horizonte and Salvador, proved the potential for integrated living and digital organisation for city wards.

The opportunity for Sapien's methods to be extended to a grander scale came in 1992 with the redevelopment of Astana during the phased dissolution of the Soviet Union. Famously, despite several issues during the re-entry of Kazakhstan into the free market, the “integrated city” proved that digital planning, human-aware environments, and pre-emptive healthcare could lead to happier living with greater individual agency.

Sapien's first major super-terrestrial venture was the extension of the Freedom and Liberty space stations in 2030: including large viewing galleries on the new habitation modules. Sapien has continued to provide modules for and complete visions for off-world operations, tending to assist private investors.

## ventures

Sapien's acclaimed hospitals and medical centres have saved countless lives since their opening in the late 1980s. This is a trend we are proud to continue and to have brought to space, even designing and manufacturing specialist equipment for off-world care. [Ventures](/subcontractors/ventures-by-sapien/) offers protection and relief every year to thousands of people carving their own adventures in space.

## SpaceTrans

To provide ad-hoc medical care at short notice, Sapien is proud to work with [SpaceTrans Inc.](/subcontractors/spacetrans-inc/) to get medical professionals and patients where they need to be.
