A European multinational who specialise in satellite technology, they are leaders in radiation management and habitation control.

## Specialists in Satellites
From storm-monitoring on Mars, chemical monitoring on Venus, to connecting over 5 billion people every day, Kepler operates over 5,000 satellites around the solar system, and over 17,000 micro-sats. Homes across the solar system trust Kepler Automation to stay in touch with their families, and safe from danger.

When Météo Astronomique commissioned the first-ever solar-flair warning system, it was Kepler that they entrusted the task to. When Martian settlements needed to navigate, it was Kepler they chose to help them find their way. When you can't afford for it not to work, Kepler is the only choice.

## Leaders in Spaceflight
Kepler is the trend-setter in vacuum and radiation systems: filing over 300 patents annually, we work with industry leaders to make novel materials and electronics accessible to the space industry.

Kepler Research GmbH, developed the award-winning Flusshalt-X, providing ten times longer hull lifetimes and five times stronger stopping power than steel or aluminium plating of the same thickness. To enable the benefits of this development to be shared, Kepler chose to license this product to AdMaG. Similarly, Kepler developed the radiation shielding material Flussmitteldurchlässig-VII, the intellectual property for which has since been licensed to ElectroProtect.

## StarDream™
Originally developed for Dougledyne Astrosystems | Fletchel Constructors (who are no longer active in the field), Kepler Automation retained the rights to its advanced user-interface system, now known as StarDream. The most deeply trained speech, gesture, and body language recognition system on the market, StarDream offers a convenient front-end interface for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. With development APIs for Python 4.1+, C++29, Rust 2.56, Gyst, and Embedded C, StarDream can be easily implemented into pre-existing hardware setups, or complete sensor packages are available for purchase.

Contact a [StarDream](https://uksdc.org/competition-resources/subcontractors/stardream/) representative to discuss licensing options appropriate your your application.

## Bridging Worlds Since 2020
Kepler Automation International GmbH is a European multinational space contractor. Formed in 2020 as a joint venture between Südlandwerke AG and Marcel Systèmes SA. Kepler Automation boasts the former's experience of systems integration on major defense and aerospace projects, coupled with the latter's expertise in unmanned space platforms and autonomous systems.

The pioneering discoveries of 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler inspired our name, along with our mission statement: “To equip humanity with an advanced space fleet built upon our engineering excellence, opening pathways to new reaches of the Solar System”.

During the 2010s, Europe found itself in an increasingly competitive space sector, with significant pressure from American, Chinese and Indian rivals. This prompted European governments to push for more collaboration
between engineering companies in order to protect and grow the continent's domestic space industry. Südlandwerke and Marcel Systèmes answered this call with the 2020 merger of their respective space divisions to form Kepler Automation, a joint venture company.

Our independence and sole focus on space engineering allowed
us to become competitive in short time. By 2024, Kepler Automation had already established itself as the satellite partner of choice for European governments, being selected as prime contractor for AWYRNET-7, Europe's satellite defense grid. At any given time, three AWYRNET satellites are over mainland Europe ready to intercept any man-made or natural threats.
