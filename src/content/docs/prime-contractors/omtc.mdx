A Martian logistics and resource trading company estimated to be the richest organisation ever. Information about the workings of the company is closely guarded.

## Like Clockwork
OMTC services keep life off-Earth possible, moving over 1 Mt around the solar system every day. Estimates suggest that a Martian, Hermian, or space-dweller is always within arm's reach of a product or material that was handled by OMTC. When you need it to get to you, OMTC is the only choice: in 30 years of operation no item that we have handled has arrived behind schedule*.

## Perfect Every Time**
OMTC operates over 70 [cargo handling facilities](/subcontractors/omtc-transport-services/), both terrestrial and orbital. Using state of the art logistical motion planning, we achieve the highest energy efficiency and shortest transfer times of any cargo handling facilities. OMTC customers typically require 10% less delta-v to move their payloads than our closest competitor***.

OMTC has at least one facility in orbit around each major body in the inner solar system, with 25 around both Mars and Earth, all equipped with our signature ship-scale mass drivers and magnetic field recoil dampers.

## Reaching New Heights
With the completion of the [Nix Space Elevator](/subcontractors/omtc-nix/) at our home facility near Ascreaus Mons, OMTC now handles 85% of transport on and off Mars. This investment has toppled launch costs, making way for Mars to become the industrial centre of the solar system. OMTC is proud to support Martian companies by offering reduced lift-costs to new and small businesses. Contact OMTC to find out how we can help you to “elevate” your business.

## A Brief History of OMTC

<Steps>

1. #### 2004 Founded as The Logistics Co
    OMTC began as a technology startup applying cloud computing and data analysis within the logistics and supply chain management industry. By 2014 The Logistics Co. had constructed its own global logistics infrastructure, able to compete with established names in the industry due to its efficiency and lightweight operating model.

2. #### 2012 Space Logistics and a Hostile Takeover
    Started entering logistics for space sector: transporting fuels safely for major launch contractors. However, many of the company shareholders felt that The Logistics Co was being too reserved in its venture into the space industry and supported a hostile takeover, led by current CEO Preston Ash. This led to rapid expansion of the company, both in its on-Earth and space logistics divisions.

3. #### 2022 Aquisition of Tysat
    Tysat was a UK based satellite manufacturer and aspiring launch company operating from Sutherland spaceport - and was renamed Tysat Logistics. The newly formed company continued developing small/medium launch capabilities for third party satellite development. Leveraging their global logistics capabilities to increase their efficiency and lower costs. OMTC also began developing subscription based online trading platform where manufacturers could sell off-the-shelf aerospace components.

4. #### 2036 First Tender Application
    Having consolidated a vast array of capabilities within the aerospace sector, we turned our gaze to the lucrative contracts being put out to tender by the Foundation Society, including the tender for Alaskol and Arial.

5. #### 2039 25th Aniversary - Company Rebranding
    To mark our 25th anniversary and acknowledge our new vision as a major space megastructure player, the company rebranded as Olympus Mons Trading Company.
