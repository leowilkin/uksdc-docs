In order to make the RFP more manageable, it is broken down into sections that encapsulate linked concepts. The traditional company structure has a department to manage the requirements and deliverables of each of these sections.

It is important to recognise that the requirements of one department may imply a restriction on the settlement design that applies to everyone! Likewise, a design concept to fulfil one design requirement might be able to solve problems elsewhere. Therefore, it is advisable to understand the RFP as a complete entity, rather than a collection of sections!

## RFP Structure

RFPs in the current style are broken up into five named sections, of which the ‘Statement of Work’ is the most important. Within the statement of work, the requirements of the design and the requested deliverables are divided into five ‘core sections’.
