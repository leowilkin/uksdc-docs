## Role

The department is responsible for the operational systems that are required to fulfil the technical core functions of the settlement, and protocols needed for the settlement to meet its purpose.

## Skills

- Creative problem solving
- Planning
- Logical thinking
- Attention to detail

## Key Responsibilities

- Design processes that allow the settlement to reach initial operating capacity as well as maintaining it after that.
- Design systems and processes that allow the settlement to function successfully.
- Innovate to produce methods of increasing the functional efficiency of the settlement over time
- Provide contingencies for emergency situations

## Strategy

The Missions Systems department will play a huge role in any successful proposal, because they will prioritise that the core functions of the settlement are achieved.

Despite having their own RfP section, Mission Systems should work with all departments throughout the day to ensure that everyone aligns to the same shared vision.

Design concurrently: work with the best available information and stay flexible. Different numbers will come in at different points so do the best with that you have at the time.
