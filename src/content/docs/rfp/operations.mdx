## Role

The Operations Engineering group have the daunting task of working out how the base will function on a day-to-day basis. Join this department if you enjoy managing multifaceted workflows and coordinating and optimising the operation of multiple, inter-linked systems.

## Skills

- Logistics
- Attention to detail
- Flexibility
- Planning

## Key Responsibilities

- Provide life support systems for residents
- Produce power to run the settlement
- Ensure the settlement is able to fulfil its purpose
- Put procedures in place to manage the settlement

## Strategy

Operations Engineering has got its own section in the RFP, however members of this department will often find themselves working to facilitate other departments’ RFP points. This department will see the most benefit from a Systems Engineer role.

If you’re working in this department, make sure you account for all the latest changes across all other departments. Operations has to integrate the design as a whole, making sure that everyone’s hard work meshes into an operable settlement. Developing mathematical models to calculate operations requirements will save time when changes to other departments force changes to Operations.
