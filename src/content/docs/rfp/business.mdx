## Role

When it comes to big projects, clients must be convinced that you can actually manage your claims. The Business and Marketing group (renamed to Schedule and Cost if there are no specific business goals) are responsible for showing your professional competence to the Foundation Society.

## Skills

- Attention to detail
- Estimation
- Business acumen
- Entrepreneurship

## Key Responsibilities

- Compilation and orchestration of the final presentation
- Explain the costs for the design
- Show how the design will be realised on time
- Ensure that the settlement fulfils business goals

## Strategy

Workers in this department should be integrated into the other departments to keep track of costs and develop plans for bringing designs to fruition. Ensuring that costs are tracked as systems are included in the design ensures better accuracy in the final total. Considering cost reduction at the design stage is critical to realistically reducing costs.

Business plans should be considered as early as possible, so that any derived requirements can be passed to the appropriate department.
