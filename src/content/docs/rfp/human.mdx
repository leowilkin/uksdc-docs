## Role

The most important part of any settlement, is the people on it. Their safety comes before any stated commercial goals. The Human Engineering group has to ensure that each and every person who will live on this base is in a comfortable environment.

## Skills

- Visual communication
- 2D design and planning
- Maths
- Psychology

## Key Responsibilities

- Ensure that residents are comfortable
- Protect residents’ health
- Provide for the social needs of individuals
- Ensure the protection of residents from industrial functions

## Strategy

The Human Engineering team will likely start working on their sections in parallel with Structural Design. This can cause conflicts later on when human requirements are not possible due to the structure chosen; for example Human might require 24 million cubic feet of air, which might not fit in the structure designed.

It is therefore imperative that the Human group communicate with other departments to ensure that their requirements aren’t impeded by work others are doing. This is especially important with respect to internal layout. Furthermore, the Human engineering slides should be the most visually engaging of the presentation in order to sell your design. These will be time-consuming, so ensure that they do not have to be scrapped due to design changes.
