description: Structural Design roles and responsibilities

## Role

The structural team will define the settlement design that all other departments rely on. This team will create drawings and external views of the settlement.

Join this department if you enjoy working with mechanical systems, material science, physics and problem solving.

## Skills

- Physical intuition
- Spatial reasoning
- Drawing or CAD
- Creative problem solving

## Key Responsibilities

- Design the overall structure of the settlement
- Provide other departments with dimensions for designs
- Select the core materials required to build settlement
- Assist other teams with locating and fitting their parts

## Strategy

At the beginning of any space design competition, the structural engineering division have the crucial task of laying out a basic design. Many teams have had their entire proposals derailed by a structural team who didn’t lay out their vision clearly or flexibly enough.

This department must be the primary source of knowledge on the physics and geometry of the settlement (e.g. artificial gravity, available volume etc.). Furthermore, ensure that a subteam of this department is working on materials early on. Knowing what you’re making your settlement out of early on assists in defining the construction process and supply logistics.
