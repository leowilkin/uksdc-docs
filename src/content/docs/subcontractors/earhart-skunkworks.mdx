## Company Background

Earhart Skunkworks is the materials research and development arm of Earhart Advanced Industries. As an owned entity, they are subject to the 20% reduction rule for Foundation Society contracts. As such, EAI may use EAI Skunkworks products at 80% of the listed price.

## Company Product Overview

EAI-Skunkworksâ€™ primary product is a soft-magnetic titanium alloy. The material achieves a yield strength of 1250 MPa, and an ultimate tensile strength of 2000 MPa at standard conditions. These strengths halve every 600 degrees, up to its melting point of 2023 K. The density and other mechanical properties are equivalent to other high-performance titanium alloys. The excellent thermal performance is believed to be due to the formation of a solid solution of nickel within the metal structure, although the exact chemical composition is a trade secret.

## Product Pricing

You can purchase this material for only $40/kg from EAI-Skunkworks for use in all your space related applications.
