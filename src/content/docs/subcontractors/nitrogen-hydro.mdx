With the advent of major space Settlements in the 2030s and 2040s, a gap in the market for life sustaining gases appeared. Just like the gases they supply, Nitrogen-Hydro rapidly expanded to fill this available space in the market. The company also sells its flagship product, water, which is marketed as; “Never having been touched by human pollution, free from additives and contamination.”

Nitrogen-Hydro ships nitrogen, oxygen, and clean water from its facilities. Liquid nitrogen and water are shipped in sealed CASSSC’s from their production facilities at Alaskol and Argonom.

Liquid nitrogen is priced at $0.15 per litre, liquid oxygen at $1.5 per litre, while the flagship product, water, is priced $5 per litre.
