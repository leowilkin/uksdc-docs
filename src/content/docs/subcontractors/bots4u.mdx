The company offers to build robots to customer specification and constructs them at their plant at Alexandriat. The company charges a $10,000 deposit per currently available function, and then $700 per unit produced. The company may be willing to look into new functions provided that the Research and Development costs of $10,000,000 per function are covered by the customer, as well as increasing the cost per unit to $1200.
