Originally a firm of injury lawyers, Bots4U gathered data to support a workplace robot marketing campaign. They designed robots to handle typical injury inducing activities such as moving furniture and used their data to convince companies that it was an essential investment in order to protect their employeees. Whilst its seems counterintuitive for an injury lawyer firm to prevent injuries, they knew the value of the market and the business skyrocketed within the first 2 years of the release of their first bot. This provided them with the R&D budget required to invest into design of home use robots, which is now their main source of revenue.

Bots4U offers purpose-built robots for home and office use only. Currently available functions for robots are cleaning household surfaces, washing dishes, doing laundry, moving furniture and fetching household items for their owners.

The company offers to build robots to customer specification and constructs them at their plant at Alexandriat. The company charges a $10,000 deposit per currently available function, and then $700 per unit produced. The company may be willing to look into new functions provided that the Research and Development costs of $10,000,000 per function are covered by the customer, as well as increasing the cost per unit to $1200.
