CRISPR Cod sell, despite their name, a large variety of genetically modified fish from their base at Liberty. Established by a group of fishermen from the Scottish Highlands, this company has long been researching genetic modification in order to increase fish yields. As such they had the necessary expertise to adapt their fish to survive and thrive in all gravitational environments up to 1g, perfect for the rapid expansion of space settlements.

CRISPR Cod sells its fish eggs at a competitive average price of $500 per 1kg(~3,000 eggs), presuming safe transportation, the fish are guaranteed to provide greater yields of produce with greater resistance to parasites and diseases.

In efforts to curb the potency of the release of any genetically modified organisms into the greater environment, each fish has had its reproductivity slightly diminished, meaning that a colony of fish will decrease slightly with each generation requiring a regular top up of eggs.
