## Company Background

Orbital Foundry was originally part of a major Canadian aerospace conglomerate, but was bought out by CEO and Spanish billionaire Isabella Gonz√°lez during the construction of Bellevistat in order to capitalise on the growth in stock value. The company was a major provider for the Foundation Society in that project and has since been involved in almost every mega-project.

## Company Product Overview

Orbital Foundry accepts ores from off world mining operations, refines the metals and produces rolled sheets, extruded beams and custom shaped parts manufactured by cutting or turning processes.

## Product Pricing

Orbital Foundry is capable of a throughput of 2,000 kg of product per hour, charging $0.15 per kg of ore given and processed through them or $0.20 per kg directly bought. They have processing facilities on Earth, Bellevistat, and Alaskol. They will not pay for shipping of products or stock for customers.
