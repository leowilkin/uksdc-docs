Synthetic Seeds are based in Lunar orbit and have used their extreme remoteness to render any restrictions on genetically modified organisms redundant, allowing for far greater experimentation into seed modification. They are famed for their web portal, offering consumers the ability to customise the taste of the produce grown, along with almost all aspects of each plantâ€™s genetics.

They manufacture genetically modified plants with efficiencies that are getting close to the theoretical maximum of 11%. In ideal scenarios this leads to a doubling of growth rates, a doubling of yields, a lesser need for resources, and complete immunity to any known parasite or disease.

However, their enhanced reproductivity has meant that on Foundation Society settlements, areas dedicated to farming these seeds require full automation, with separate atmosphere processing and additional measures to ensure that no seeds are released into the greater environment.

Prices are on average $1 per seed, with other offerings such as infertile trees saplings that can mature in as little as 5 years priced at $100 dollars per sapling.
