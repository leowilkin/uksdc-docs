The small Aquila vehicle, originally developed to support lunar mining, hold the distinctions of being the most-launched platform on Earth.

The Aquila launch vehicle can lift 100 metric tonnes into orbit for a price of $5,000,000 per launch from Earth into anywhere within Low Earth Orbit, with this capacity being reduced to 80 tonnes for launches to L1.The Grypus rocket is able to carry 225 tonnes into Low Earth Orbit and 200 to L1, although come at the cost of $11,000,000 per flight.
