Ventures, by Sapien is the off-world branch of Sapien Medical, more commonly know just as “Ventures” or “Sapien Ventures”. They manufacture medical supplies and equipment for use in reduced- and zero-gravity. From their home at Liberty they are at the cutting edge of medicine, able to construct complete advanced artificial organs for use in humans, highly structured targeted medicines, and primitive biochemical nanobots.

Ventures is the commercial medical arm of Sapien, providing medical equipment suited for reduce- and zero-gravity environments at only double the cost of terrestrial equipment, plus shipping from low-Earth-orbit.

Ventures offers a medical insurance package for off-Earth settlements at the low price of $15,000 per annum for settlements with integrated health monitoring to allow for preventative measures. Ventures can source and verify monitoring equipment for a 200% surcharge (i.e., the cost of health-monitoring systems will be tripled if you want to register them with Ventures to access lower insurance rates). Exposure to radiation above 15 mSv per calendar year will be insured to the same level for $25,000, plus an additional $1,000 per year per excess mSv. Workers in high-risk positions, e.g. from mechanical, electrical, or vacuum hazards, must be insured at $30,000 per annum due to their higher risk of injury requiring transfer to a Ventures-run hospital in low-Earth-orbit.

Ventures also provides routine and emergency medical kits for $400 and $80 respectively. Routine medical kits are validated only for one year and are adequate to treat minor, routine, injuries for up to 20 people. The emergency medical kits provide stabilisation for minor to moderate traumatic injuries adequate to allow a patient to reach a medical centre. They should be replaced after use due to depletion of critical items and are not adequate for healing traumatic injuries, some of which may still require evacuation of the patient to a hospital facility.
