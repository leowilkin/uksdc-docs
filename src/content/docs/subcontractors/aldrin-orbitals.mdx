Aldrin Orbitals is an offshoot management company of the Foundation Society, created to operate the Aldrin Cycler, Benevectoras. Benevectoras is advertised as the safest and cheapest way to travel between the two planets, and offers many luxuries often not found on interplanetary spacecraft for the voyage, including a swimming pool.

Aldrin Orbitals allow for the transport of passengers between Earth and Mars and vice versa. They specifically operate between the space ports of Columbiat and Aresam.

Benevectoras is actually 6 separate spacecraft, allowing transfers from Earth to Mars and Mars to Earth almost every 8 months. One-way tickets cost $700 per day for the 146 day transit.
