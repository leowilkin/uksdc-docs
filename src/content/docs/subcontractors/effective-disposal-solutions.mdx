Effective Disposal Solutions offers a final disposal service for irreducible waste products out of internal reprocessing systems. This includes dealing with hazardous waste such as spent nuclear fission fuel. Ultimate disposal involves questionable ethical decisions in the name of capitalism; these involve burying waste on areas of moons currently devoid of human habitation, or using reentry conditions to sublimate or autoclave certain materials.

Effective Disposal Solutions charge by the mass of the material to be disposed of, charging $5,000 per kg, requiring the waste to be delivered to their facilities in lunar orbit. Due to the high demand for their services, they limit the use of their services for a single client to 2,000 kg a year.
