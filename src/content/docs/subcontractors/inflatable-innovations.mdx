Established in the late 2020s by an entrepreneurial Australian balloon artist, Inflatable Innovations capitalised on the space boom of the early 2030s to establish itself as the leading manufacturer of inflatable space habitats.

Inflatable Innovations specialises in making inflatable buildings to customer specifications, to enable quick construction of new communities. Although these structures are not intended for permanent or indefinite use, they provide shelter for residents to start new economic activities, until more durable solutions can be established. They are manufactured at Bellevistat for the customerâ€™s collection. The company charges for construction of inflatable facilities at a rate determined by cost = 15,000 + (600*V), where V is the enclosed volume in m3. The shelters provide no protection against radiation but are 90% thermally insulative.
