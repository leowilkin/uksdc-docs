Custom Cargo Accommodations (CCA) produces Cargo Accommodation Standard Space Shipping Containers (CASSSCs), compatible with standard interfaces on all launch vehicles and interorbital spacecraft currently in use. Taking inspiration from the shipping industry on earth, the Foundation Society decided in 2038 that all extraterrestrial cargo must be transported in CASSSCs.

CASSSCs are 9 metres long with 4.5m x 4.5m cross-section, and when empty they weigh 10 metric tonnes each.  Generic CASSSCs are aluminium or steel and can be fully air-tight or can be vented to permit pressure equalisation. Each CASSSC costs $2,000 for hire for one year, presuming return to a facility for refurbishment, or $12,000 for the full purchase of one.

In standard Earth gravity, assuming an approximately even distribution of load:  

(i) CASSSCs can be placed in stacks of 13 for transport.

(ii) CASSSCs are capable of carrying 60 metric tonnes of cargo

Thanks to Foundation Society backing, CASSSCs are now available from distribution facilities at all major Foundation Society settlements and transportation hubs.
