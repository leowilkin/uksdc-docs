Svalbard Seeds have expanded their mission to catalogue and store the genetic information of all plants, as well as to provide seeds to anyone wishing to purchase them. Originally based in Svalbard, Sweden, they have since moved their base of operations to Argonom and have constructed the solar systemâ€™s largest seed vault there, with the hope to spread natural plants to all corners of the solar system.

Svalbard seeds sell all types of seed and cutting at a price of $1 dollar per 100 seeds or cuttings. It is required that these seeds be transported in refrigerated containers to prevent them from germinating before being planted. Customers are also informed that it is standard for around 50% of seeds not to grow properly, and so to order appropriately.
