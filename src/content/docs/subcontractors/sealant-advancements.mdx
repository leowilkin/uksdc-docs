## Company Background

Established by an American chemist, Sealant Advancements was born out of a chemical experiment that initially showed little promise of producing any desirable products. However, after being left forgotten in the back of a fume cupboard, Luke Johnson returned to find a transparent layer of solid material, underneath which a gas bubble could be seen. Further investigation into this material showed it to be an excellent sealant to prevent gas leaks, although it did not have the strength to contain pressures above 100 Pa.

## Company Product Overview

Sealant Advancements makes paint and coatings from near-Earth asteroid mined materials that provide air-tight surfaces on rock, SuperAdobe, and other porous surfaces. Application is done with standard paintbrushes or aerosols and the surface requires 30 Earth days to dry before being capable of retaining air. These are produced at Bellevistat where the company holds a stock of 50,000 litres priced at $55 per litre. To be effective the paint requires a coating thickness of 0.5 mm and it has a density of 2,000 kg/mÂ³. An indefinitely sized layer of the coating can only bear a pressure difference of 100 Pa when unsupported.
