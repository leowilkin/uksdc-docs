StarDream is a product by Kepler Automation, entitling them to quote a 20% lower cost to the Foundation Society.

StarDream is a software package for seamless human-machine interfacing: it provides voice, gesture, and body language recognition. It provides 2.4x greater intention-recognition than its nearest competitor. Development APIs for Python 4.1+, C++29, Rust 2.56, Gyst, and Embedded C, are available to implemented StarDream into pre-existing hardware setups. Kepler also sell detection modules that are sufficient to receive commands in a 10 by 10 metre room (assuming a ceiling height of less than 3 metres), so long as there are no interruptions in the sight-line to the user.

StarDream Domestic is licensed per point of detection at a cost of $400 per annum. The detection module is priced at $600 and includes a domestic license for one year. StarDream Commercial is licensed at $500 per detection location per annum and is intended for business settings, such as offices, shops, etc. StarDream Industrial is the most advanced and capable package and is licensed per user (for safety) at a cost of $1,000 per annum.
