Maisie Watson started out as a humble postie from the West Midlands before she decided to found Confirmed Couriers in 2037. She realised that their had to be a better way to track deliveries and ensure that all customers received their parcels safely and in a timely manner. Using her experience as a postie, she rapidly expanded the business to handle tracking of almost 1/4 of all earth based parcels, before expanding the companiesâ€™ ventures into space in 2041.

Confirmed Couriers has a large number of offices in all major settlements and transport hubs from where they track and manage the transfer of cargo for their clients. They have negotiated with the Foundation Society an agreement for the tracking of cargo for settlement construction and operations in cislunar space.

Confirmed Couriers charge $350 per CASSSC for the tracking of the cargo, as well as managing the transfer of cargo between carriers at each stage on its journey. All cargo must be signed off and confirmed as delivered by the recipient, to ensure all parcels reach their destination safely.
