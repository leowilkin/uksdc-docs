Consegna Veloce operates interplanetary charter vehicles for either cargo or passenger transportation. Their crewed spacecraft called Caroliners, named after their late founder Carola Genovese.

Caroliners can carry payloads of up to 120,000 kg or up to 30 passengers, and can travel to and from almost anywhere in orbit within the inner solar system. In order to reduce radiation exposure, and to increase shipment times as well, Caroliners are designed to engage longer burns, reducing the transit times between destinations to around half that of a typical Hohmann transfer. Each Caroliner is a cylindrical with a diameter of 9 meters and length of 70 meters.

They charge either $15.54 per tonne per m/s of delta v for cargo or $1,200 per day of travel for passengers.
