Large Print was founded in the early 2030s when the founder Michelle Langer started to notice a build up in the number of old 3D printing robots. Large Print buy these robots and adapt them to be able to print on Lunar and Martian surfaces.

Their mobile printer designs are capable of operating in a vacuum and can achieve 10 mm accuracies as they deposit Superadobe at a rate of 1 litre per second. Their print volume is unrestricted.

Each unit costs $450,000 and is supplied from Alaskol.
