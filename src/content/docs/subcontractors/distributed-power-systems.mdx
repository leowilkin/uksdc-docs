As with all space technology, Distributed Power Systems noticed that there would be a great reduction in transport costs if they moved their manufacturing processes off earth, and so quickly secured themselves a place on the Alexandriat settlement. They have used near earth asteroid mining to source necessary materials and have therefore been able to produce products at very affordable prices.

Distributed Power Systems is the leading supplier of wire harnesses for distribution of electrical power, and fibre optics for electronic signals on spacecraft, manufacturing them for traditional prices at Alexandriat.

The companyâ€™s latest venture is a system for zero-g manufacturing of solar cells from materials available in silicate asteroids. Distributed Power Systems sells each of these units, which can be transported as an 8 CASSSC block, for $80,000,000, not including transportation to deposit it on an appropriate asteroid where it produces square 0.5 m solar panels at the rate of 100 per day, each of which is capable of 38% efficiency and weighs 1 kg.
