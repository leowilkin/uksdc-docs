Dangerous Packages emerged as an offshoot from the now inactive Vulture Aviation, and now acts as an independent firm with regular contracts with almost every major space settlement. Their company motto is; “If no one else will take it, we will.”

Dangerous Packages is a transportation company that specialises in the controversial movement of hazardous material from one location to another. This includes the nuclear material that is used in nuclear fission power generation.

Based at Alexandriat, their spacecraft are crewed, and charge $25,000 a day for the transportation of up to 5,000 kg of hazardous material to anywhere in orbit in the inner solar system.
