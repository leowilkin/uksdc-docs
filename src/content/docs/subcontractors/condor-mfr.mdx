The Condor MFR launches out of the Republic of Nauru, an island nation lying very close to the equator, in order to maximise the vehicleâ€™s lift capacity. As such, the Condor MFR is able to lift 150 tonnes into Low Earth Orbit at a price of only $7,000,000 per launch due to their cheap, but effective, manufacturing methods of bio-fuels.

Corporate Links:
Due to the fact that Condor is manufacturing its own propellants in house, they are able to claim a 20% reduction in the listed costs for Foundation Society contracts.
