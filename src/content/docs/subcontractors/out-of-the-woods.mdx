## Company Background

Having grown up in the rainforests of Borneo, founder Dinihari binti Osman repeatedly stresses the virtues of design involving wood, inciting the calming and homely feel it creates, something that when she first set foot on Balderol she felt was sorely missing.

## Company Product Overview

Out of the Woods is a small organisation that operates one of only a handful of off-world tree farms. They are based at Balderol and produce their wood as byproduct from their main task of COâ‚‚ removal.

## Product Pricing

They sell a huge variety of wood from Oak to Purple Heart cut into regular sizes for an average of $500 per cubic metre. However, their manufacturing capacity is limited to 8 tonnes of exports a year.
