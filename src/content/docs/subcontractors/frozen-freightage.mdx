Frozen Freightage do their best to provide refrigerated CASSSCs for almost any kind of cargo, be that transport of foodstuffs, chemicals or biological samples. However, perhaps their most famous CASSSC is the walk in wine cellar owned by founder and CEO Jacques Boudon which is rumoured to travel with him at all times.

Frozen Freightage modifies special order CASSSCs with equipment to allow for the pressurised, isothermal, and sterile transportation of special requirements cargo. These heavily specialised CASSSCs require a near constant power source, usually running off the spacecraftâ€™s electrical system, and have all their thermal insulation and cooling built in.

The equipment and insulation to keep cargo at a specified constant temperature anywhere between 120K and 290K takes up space inside the CASSSC, reducing the usable volume to 5 metres long with a 2 metre square cross section. The empty mass of the CASSSC has also been increased to 10 metric tonnes.

They buy and then modify CASSSCs at Alexandriat, selling them on for $90,000 each.
