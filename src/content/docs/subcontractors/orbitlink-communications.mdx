This Subcontractor has been retired from the UKSDC as of the 2023 National Finals. It will be kept on the website for historical value for any teams using old RFPs for practice.

OrbitLink Communications was established when the Alexandriat Space Settlement was under construction to augment standard communications channels. This was following a Foundation society survey that showed that the key factor putting people off of moving to their new settlements was the lack of access to YouTube.

Individuals who insist on transmitting and receiving data-hogging video and interactive real-time data with Earth-based services do so by paying exorbitant fees to OrbitLink. The company has made arrangements to place one of its antennas and dedicated fibre optics links on every Foundation Society settlement at zero cost, however transmissions through it are charged per byte. It is, therefore, unsustainable for primary communications.
