Established in 2029 by Thomas Tezla, Personal PCBs supported some of the earliest ventures of the Foundation Society and market themselves as the solar systemâ€™s finest custom electronics manufacturer. Upon construction of Bellevistat they were given a complimentary fabrication plant there to allow them to be closer to their end users reducing transport costs.

Personal PCBs manufacture pretty much any electronic device using a large variety of consumer and professional chips based on RISC-V instruction set, and their open source derivatives.

Using material gained from asteroid mining, their electronics have prices comparable to custom electronics found on earth. All their electronics have a 4 year warranty (dependent on proof of shielding and good power regulation) and are shock and acceleration resistant.
