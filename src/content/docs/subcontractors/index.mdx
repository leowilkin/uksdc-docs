Subcontractors are companies that you can hire within the competition to provide your company with specific goods or services. Both in the real world and in the UKSDC, engineering subcontractors are the backbone of large projects; allowing prime contractors to tap into specialist knowledge, facilities, and experience.

You should keep track of all of the subcontractors that you use in your design, including the costs of their services. You will need to put these in your presentation. While that might be a pain, itâ€™s better than having to design everything yourself!

Our subcontractors are divided into categories below:
