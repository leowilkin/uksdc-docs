It was always clear that roads in space would have to be constructed in a different way to those on earth. Launching the required, dense material into space simply could not be done in an economical way. Thankfully Planetary pavers forsaw this problem and began research in the mid 2020s into grading, paving and sintering machinery that could work in space. As their founder says ‘No matter where you are in the solar system, you can always count on the fact that at some point you will need to be somewhere else!’ Planetary pavers strive to make those journeys as easy and comfortable as possible for you.

“Planetary Pavers operates customised autonomous road-building equipment on off-world settlements. The company’s grading and paving machinery is solar powered with 14 Earth days of battery life for operation in darkness. Their capabilities include breaking rock to make gravel and sintering regolith to create a hard and smooth road surface. After a surface is levelled about 1km of paved surface can be completed every 24 hours.

Pricing is done based on the width of the road and the time taken for project completion. An initial contracting fee of $15,000,000 is levied followed by $1,000,000 per 20 metres width, rounded up, per day.”
